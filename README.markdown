== Short story

Minimally tested but interesting stuff

== Long story

Use stuff here at your own risk. Most of this works, and will work in most situations but may not take care validations, extreme cases, wrong data passed.

Its tested for basic use cases. Samples should help you. Don't use in production, or release for others to use. Use for personal use if you have too. 


Feel free to fork and further develop stuff in here, or submit patches to me.

Some of this stuff may move to extras or core if its really useful and stable.
